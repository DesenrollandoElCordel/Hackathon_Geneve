#### Dataset of the [Desenrollando el Cordel](https://desenrollandoelcordel.unige.ch/inicio.html) Project

Our collection consists of 912 pliegos, divided into two distinct sub-collections. The first, the Moreno collection, includes 373 chapbooks from the Carmona printer José María Moreno. The second, the Varios collection comprises 539 chapbooks from various printers across the Iberian Peninsula, including Barcelona, Madrid, and Córdoba.

The texts in the Moreno collection were transcribed using Transkribus, while the texts in the Varios collection were transcribed using the Fondue instance. To ensure accuracy, the transcriptions were rigorously corrected by native Spanish speakers.

Place names were automatically detected using the Flair tool. We classified these place names according to the following categories:
* Countries/Kingdoms/Empires/Continents
* Villages/Cities/Regions
* Monuments/Buildings
* Natural Sites

Among the detected places, some names were classified as unclassifiable and ambiguous.
